I am a master student at University of Washington. My reserach interests inlude reinforcement learning, multiagent learning, and robotics. I am passionate about the interdisciplinary potential between robotics and language, especially how to leverage foundational models, such as vision-langauge-model (VLM), vision-language-action model (VLA) to improve the generalization and robustiness of robot policies. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Abhishek Gupta](https://abhishekunique.github.io/) and [Natasha Jaques](https://natashajaques.ai/). Before that I worked as a software development engineer at Amazon AGI, focusing on developing data preparation infrastructure used for large language model training, after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Computer Science.

During the spare time, I enjoy running, reading, and hanging out with my [cat](https://yuanjiayiy.github.io/chunky/).

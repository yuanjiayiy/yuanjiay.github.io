I like to model everything. Some might call me a reductionist. But I cannot resist the appeal of describing the everyday complex phenomenons, such as weather, grocery price, or interpersonal relations, in terms of mathematical symbols and functions with certain input space and output space. Studying computer science and mathematics allows me to do that in a more rigorous fashion. It teaches me a language to describe a problem space so that my ideas can be communicated universally. Studying neuroscience allows me to see both the complexiticity and simplicity of the world I live in. We can describe our minds as simple as an ensemble of electrical pulses, but the complexity lies in that our coordination, our neuroplasticity and biological efficiency (compared to its power-hungry machine counterpart).

I am currently a master student at University of Washington. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Abhishek Gupta](https://abhishekunique.github.io/) and [Natasha Jaques](https://natashajaques.ai/). Before that I worked as a software development engineer at Amazon AGI, focusing on developing data preparation infrastructure used for large language model (LLM) training. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Computer Science with University Honor. I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, multiagent learning, and robotics.

- Reinforcement learning:
- Robotics: How does the size and variety of training data affect the generalization and robustiness of a vision-language-action model (VLA)? How far are we from a generalist ready-to-use VLA? 

I believe that real science does not have boundary of subject. There are techniques, or tools, (I like to imagine things in a visual sense) that might potentially helpful to solve a problem, and these tools might be labeled with academic subjects such as mathmatics, economics, cognitive science, and physics. After all they are all tools. We should open to learn to any tools that would be useful to our goal. 

During the spare time, I enjoy running, reading, and hanging out with my [cat](https://yuanjiayiy.github.io/chunky/).
